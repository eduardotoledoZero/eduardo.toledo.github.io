 am System Engineer from National University of Colombia graduated in 1994 with a Master of
Economic sciences from Pontifical Javerian University obtained in 2002 and a specialization in Project
Management from Colombian School of Engineering Julio Garavito. I am currently pursuing a master’s
degree in Data Analytic Intelligence from University of the Andes, which is the most prestigious
university of Colombia. All these universities appear ranked into the best 20 universities of Latin-
American.
From a young age I have been worked with and studied computational technology. In 1984, I found a
free subscription in a magazine to learn FORTRAN, a programming language that is specially suited to
numeric computation and coursed all levels using ordinary post. Once I was graduated from my high
school, I applied to National University of Colombia and got a place to study System Engineer. In order
to get a place in this University which is public, you have to pass several technical tests and be into the
best positions to be enrolled. There, its emphasis was calculus, lineal algebra, probabilities, statistics and
operational research studies, among others. My thesis was about the creation of a compiler for the
development of apps using programmable logic controllers, which were the center of the control of
manufacturing processes. Such as assembly lines, machines and robotic systems. As part of my studies
of operational research and statistics, I found some topics linked to the economic sciences and, due to it
to this interaction, I decided to start a new academic journey through Economy.
During my master in economy, I began to challenge myself academically, taking the hardest STEM
classes offered. This allowed me to complete all possible science and math courses during the three
years of the master, allowing me access to the advanced research and topics in econometric sciences
and theory of games. This led me to develop strong science and math foundations and to supplement
my background of engineering. At the end of my master in 2002, I sought to solve problems that impact
the real community and then my final graduation work focused on developing a predictive/analytic
model for the implementation of unemployment system in Colombia in order to reduce the poverty.
This model received good comments from the academy as it was one of the first models using VARIMA
modeling whose focus is for the multivariate time series prediction at that time. VARIMA is the
extension of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) which is a model of univariate time
series. A univariate time series many times results in non representative predictions due the non
inclusion of other variables that do not count towards the model. Working on this project, I saw the raw
power of predictive models, without knowing exactly at that time that what I was doing was the first
steps of Artificial Intelligence and Analytics.
The year was 1999 when I started to work with an American company called Boink System Inc. whose
mission was to develop the first multifunctional ATM for the gambling industry. My first role there was
precisely Computer Scientist .This ATM was developed initially with the functionality of Bill Breaking,
Ticket Redemption and regular financial transactions such as Withdrawal, Balance and Transfer using
Triton Protocol to connect to WorldPay. We teamed up with a multidisciplinary team among Software
Engineers like me, Electronic Engineers and UX staff to carry out this project. In order to complete this
project, we had to face some challenges to pass some certifications in some USA states such as GLI-
gaming labs international - in Nevada whose agency is responsible for providing the gaming industry’s
leading testing and certification services. In parallel, I was working in the first module of Business
Intelligence /Analytic in Boink to offer a dashboard of KPI-key performance index-of that product. In this
development, some interesting integrations were carried out by taking advantage of my background
with devices communication and specifically, the integration of Bill Validators , Encrypting Pin pad,
financial card reader and implementation of financial protocols as D91X and ISO8583 to run financial
transactions. I worked for this company almost 10 years reaching the position of Development Leader.
Boink Inc. was acquired by a FinTech called ASAI Inc. in the year 2000 and its upper management
decided to create a branch in Colombia called ASA Colombia. I became a Development Manager for all
the products of gambling in the USA. Our star product was an ATM powered by Diebold Inc. which we
had to develop all features of gambling on top of this hardware and certify it in several commission of
the states (GLI in Nevada, the commission in Washington and so on) in order to be able to operate our
products in different zones in the USA. Once we developed the core of the features for this special type
of ATM, our vision as technical team belonging to a Fintech was to use the Cloud in order to cut cost,
improve flexibility and scalability and keep our pace aligned to the new trends of the industry changes.
The final outcome of this vision and one achievement to point out is the migration of our business core
services to the cloud of Microsoft Azure using IAAS –Infrastructure as a Service-.
Also, given my previous experiences, I participated actively with the construction of the module of
reporting and analytics for them. At this point, I worked as an architect of ATM Solutions with ASAI
System Inc. while managing ASA Colombia.
In the year 2011, I opted by starting a specialization in project management given that my role
demanded the necessity of managing the full cycle of projects implementation and thus, my background
was enriched with good practices and government issued by Project Management Institute –PMI- and
agile methodologies as SCRUM. It let me to participate in projects with casinos of valuable reputation,
such as Casino Morongo Resort, Pala Casino Resort, Pechanga Casino in California, among others. New
features were developed and incorporated to the portfolio of our ATM under my leadership, such as
Cash Advance Transactions, Ticket Issuance and Electronic Check. All these new features allowed to ASAI
System Inc to get a new revenues stream through the fees billed to the customer for each transaction.
In 2017, I realized that my background as a software engineer plus my Master in Economics Sciences,
together with the arsenal of studies in probability and statistic, made a perfect match and drove me to
find a new vision in my career path connected to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Since
then, I have been developing my new skills and formalizing my knowledge until getting official
certifications in Machine Learning, Deep Learning Specialization and Machine Learning Projects on
Azure. Also, officially I am contributor of Kaggle Community which is the biggest online community
platform for Data Scientist and machine learning enthusiasts that help to resolve world problems with
AI.
